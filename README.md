# Disable-Control-Panel
Simple script that disables control panel in Windows

Made and tested on Windows 11 Home and Windows 10 Pro (Might work with older Windows
versions but I don't guarantee that it will work). It's higly reccomended to run
script as Administrator since it creates key in Registry (Accounts without Administrator
privilieges might be blocked). This script affects all users.
